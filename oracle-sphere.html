  <h1>Welcome to <i>Oracle Sphere</i></h1>
  <h2>The Legend of the Oracle Sphere</h2><br>

<h3>Deep within the archives of forgotten knowledge, hidden among lost manuscripts and whispered myths, exists the Oracle Sphere—a relic said to transcend time and reality itself. Originally crafted by an enigmatic order of scholars known as the Keepers of Fate, it was designed not merely to answer questions, but to shape destiny.<br><br>

These Keepers, masters of prophecy and the unseen forces of the universe, infused the sphere with fragmented echoes of wisdom from countless ages. Every time someone asks a question, the Sphere doesn't just respond—it pulls from ancient tomes, cosmic alignments, and the emotions of the asker to deliver an answer tailored to the moment.<br><br>

Some say the Oracle Sphere was lost during the collapse of the Celestial Library, buried under ruins where time itself stands still. Others claim it continues to exist in hidden corners of the digital world, waiting for the right mind to awaken its knowledge once more.<br><br>

But one thing is certain: its answers are never random—only those who truly seek knowledge will understand its deeper meaning</h3>
